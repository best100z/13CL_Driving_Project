# Project Description
The main goal of this project was to build a small scale self-driving car. This car would have several key capabilities. First, we wanted it to be able to drive to a specific set destination. Second, we needed the car to be able to avoid obstacles along the way to this destination. We expected the car to be able to perform all tasks on board. That is, as soon as it was plugged in/turned on, it would travel to its destination without any user input. To do this, we built the car, created a steering column and drive motor, and added several electronic components to perform the needed tasks. This README serves as an introduction into working with the car and as a guide to recreating the project.
