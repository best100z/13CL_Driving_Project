# Project Description
The main goal of this project was to build a small scale self-driving car. This car would have several key capabilities. First, we wanted it to be able to drive to a specific set destination. Second, we needed the car to be able to avoid obstacles along the way to this destination. We expected the car to be able to perform all tasks on board. That is, as soon as it was plugged in/turned on, it would travel to its destination without any user input. To do this, we built the car, created a steering column and drive motor, and added several electronic components to perform the needed tasks. This README serves as an introduction into working with the car and as a guide to recreating the project.
So, why a self driving car? As evidenced by the popularity of Tesla, a car that can drive itself is a huge draw for consumers. Not only that, but it also has many possible applications in small scale robotics. However, we decided to focus more on the human aspect of this technology. Our car has a steering column that allows it to drive like an actual car on the road. Although our car is still a work in progress, with more testing we believe that it can overcome a large variety of obstacles it may encounter. We believe that the greatest advantage for our car is its destination tracking capabilities. Small scale distance measurement is a complicated field of active research which will be detailed in section 4, along with our solution.

# Building the Car
## General Car Construction
To build the platform for the car, we used a heavily modified version of the LEGO 42123 set. The key features that remained the same were the driveshaft and the steering column. Of course, this LEGO set is not required. Beyond these two key details, much of the car is open to innovation. We used the Technic pieces that came with the set to construct the frame and mounted everything on that. To mount, we used a combination of rubber bands, Duct Tape, and minimal 3D printed parts. The main uses of 3D printing were for gears and IR sensor mountings. Rubber bands were used extensively to hold the main driving stepper motor down; however, this still resulted in skipping. Therefore, once the design of the car is finalized, a solution such as strong glue or more 3D printing would be recommended.
